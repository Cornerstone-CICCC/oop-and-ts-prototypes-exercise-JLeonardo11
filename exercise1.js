// Exercise 1: Create a Prototype
// Instructions: 
// 1. Create a constructor function called "Vehicle" that takes "make" and "model" as arguments.
// 2. Define a method called "startEngine" on the prototype of Vehicle that logs "The [make] [model] engine is starting."



function Vehicle(make, model) {
    this.make = make; 
    this.model = model;
}

Vehicle.prototype.startEngine = function() {
    return `The ${this.make} ${this.model} engine is starting.`;
};

// Test the Vehicle prototype
const myCar = new Vehicle("Toyota", "Corolla");
myCar.startEngine(); // Output: "The Toyota Corolla engine is starting."
